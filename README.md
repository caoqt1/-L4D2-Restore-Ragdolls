# -L4D2-Restore-Ragdolls
SourceMod plugin for Left 4 Dead 2. Replaces the survivor death models with ragdolls, while defib functionality.

# What makes this different from Shadowsyn's plugin?
Nothing much, besides not being able to manually create ragdolls. I guess the only thing you can argue is the fact that this plugin actually calls the function responsible for creating literal death ragdolls, rather than re-creating them by hand.
